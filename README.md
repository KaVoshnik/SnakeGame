# Snake 2

Hi! This is my first project on **Pygame**.

## Roadmap

This is a roadmap for my game, I will add different goals here, and also write how ready they are at the moment.

| Target              | Progress                                     | Percent progress |

| Main menu           | There are buttons to start the game and exit | +- 75%           |
| Difficulties        | Finished                                     | 100%             |
